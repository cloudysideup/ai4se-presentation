# Intro

- Creating business logic written in a programming language along with the
  tests to verify that code and the process of how these items are written have proven to be a
  more difficult task.
- As AI models have become more specialised and geared towards code
  creation, practitioners have embraced using it in limited purposes and researchers are
  evaluating what role artificial intelligence will have in multiple software engineering domains
  over the next several years.

---

# Thesis Statement

- Based on their research and how practitioners are currently using
  it, artificial intelligence will be used by engineers, leads and managers for augmentation and
  coaching within the domains and common processes of software engineering.
